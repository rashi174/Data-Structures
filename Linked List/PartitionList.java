/*
86. Partition List

Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.
You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [2,1], x = 2
Output: [1,2]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 200].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
-200 <= x <= 200

    public ListNode partition(ListNode head, int x) {

        // before and after are the two pointers used to create the two list
        // before_head and after_head are used to save the heads of the two lists.
        // All of these are initialized with the dummy nodes created.
        ListNode before_head = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode before = before_head;
        ListNode after_head = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode after = after_head;

        while (head != null) {

            // If the original list node is lesser than the given x,
            // assign it to the before list.
            if (head.val < x) {
                before.next = head;
                before = before.next;
            } else {
                // If the original list node is greater or equal to the given x,
                // assign it to the after list.
                after.next = head;
                after = after.next;
            }

            // move ahead in the original list
            head = head.next;
        }

        // Last node of "after" list would also be ending node of the reformed list
        after.next = null;

        // Once all the nodes are correctly assigned to the two lists,
        // combine them to form a single list which would be returned.
        before.next = after_head.next;

        return before_head.next;
